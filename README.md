Museum_landing_page

I made the website. The site has a header, menu with navigation, three sections and footer. During development, I use:

SASS preprocessor;
BEM methodology;
used variables, mixins, extends;
landing page adapts to mobile, tablet and desktop;
used grid and flex to place elements;
used transition for smooth increase of icons and pictures as links on hover.

The mockup and demo are below.
