Museum_landing_page

I made the website. The site has a header, menu with navigation, three sections and footer. During development, I use:

 - SASS preprocessor;
 - BEM methodology;
 - used grid and flex to place elements;
 - used transition for smooth increase of icons and pictures as links on hover.

The mockup and demo are below.
